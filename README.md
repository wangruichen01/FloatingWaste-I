# FloatingWaste-I Dataset

The FloatingWaste-I dataset is a multicategory floating-waste dataset containing bottles and cartons. We used an unmanned surface vehicle equipped with a DJI Pocket2 motion camera to cruise around the four lakes on the campus of Guangxi University. The FloatingWaste-I dataset was acquired in three time periods: midday, evening and night. We used labeling to annotate the data. The annotions contain ``carton'' and ``bottle''.
